Simplistic Chrome extension for SavePublishing: right now just
calls into the bookmarklet. Requires a copy of savepublishing.js
to be copied into this directory before building it, alas, and
bg.js butchers the regular bookmarklet.js file some.

The way to improve this would be to split up the credits into
something that would be a menu item from the extension, and use
Chrome's tab.executeScript() functionality to inject the
functionality rather than just do the bookmarklet thing.

All that said, this works.
